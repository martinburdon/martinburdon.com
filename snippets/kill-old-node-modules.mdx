## Snippet

```js
npx npkill
```

## Usage

Open up terminal and run the snippet.

`npkill` will scan your computer for `node_module` folders and let you choose which ones to remove as well as letting you know how large each folder is. It scans from the current directory so if you want to run it over your whole computer make sure to run it from a root dir.
